    "# Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with exit surveys from employees of the `Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)` and the `Technical and Further Education (TAFE)` institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey here and the survey for the DETE here. We've made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "They want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. In the guided steps, we'll aim to do most of the data cleaning and get you started analyzing the first question.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset. In a job setting, we'd make sure to meet with a manager to confirm the definitions of the data. For this project, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `dete_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `ID:` An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `SeparationType:` The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Cease Date:` The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `DETE Start Date:` The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the `tafe_survey.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by reading the datasets into pandas and exploring them"

    "Whoa! This goes to show that no one (or barely anyone) in DETE is less than 20 years of age as the Gen Z column is zero! \n",

    "Moreover, `Baby Boomers` are the most dissatisfied, followed by `Millennials` and then `Gen X`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concluding thoughts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. So here we can say that the older population is `more dissatisfied` and hence resign as compared to the younger crowds. But not by a mile. The number of employees who are dissatisfied to an extent is in and around the ballpark of **45-60%** which is essentially something that does show that corporates do need to make efforts in keeping their employees happy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Moreover, considering the facts that `Veterans` and `Established` employees are dissatisfied almost as much as the newbies would go on to show that the corporate might have a tough time living up to making the employees feel valued after their long years of service. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Younger employees are considered to m=be more dynamic and people preferring better working conditions and 'work-life' balance which would essentially make their outflow a bit more predictable. However as we see the outflow of `Veterans` and `Established` employees which would also go hand in hand with `Baby Boomers` and `Gen X`, the underlying reason between their outflow (as they are assumed to pursue stability and loyalty) is something that needs to be looked into. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while this quantitative data gives us a significant overview of the direction in which the trend is moving, this quanititative analysis would be incredibly helpful if complimented with a qualitative analysis of the employees to understand the underlying patterns and causes in more depth.
